### Who and what is this for?

This is for administrators who want a futuristic economy featured inside of their server without a chance of manipulation. There is a max circulation of money available to all players. Player accounts whom are inactive will be taxed over time. Taxes are re-introducted into the server allowing constant rewards for mining blocks in the block chain. Blocks are mined through server interactions such as jobs, roleplay, etc. It's entirely up to the server developer how they want to reward players.

### Features:

* 12 Word Mneumonic Wallets for new players.
* Offline Transactions between players.
* Market Caps for total wealth distribution in the server.
* Taxes old / unused player accounts to redistribute wealth into the server.
* Mine Blocks in whichever way your server would like.
* Reward players for clearing the transaction pool.
